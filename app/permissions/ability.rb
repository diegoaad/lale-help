#
# Some notes on abilities
#
# - :manage represents ANY action on the object, not just crud.
#   https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/defining-abilities
#
# - Adding can rules do not override prior rules, but instead they are logically or'ed.
#   Therefore, it is best to place the more generic rules near the top.
#   https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Ability-Precedence
#
# Abilities/CanCan can lead to a lot of confusion and wasted time!
# Ideally this would be replaced by a more straightforward auth tool. But for now:
# the recommended practises are:
#
# - TDD every abilities you add (see ability_spec).
# - don't use the :manage role unless you know exactly how it influences the other ability rules.
#   Instead, use the specific verbs you're interested in.
# - cannot is syntax sugar. Don't use it unless you know exactly how it influences the other ability rules.
#   Instead, use can rules with the inverted logic.
# - be aware there's can(...) and can?(...).
